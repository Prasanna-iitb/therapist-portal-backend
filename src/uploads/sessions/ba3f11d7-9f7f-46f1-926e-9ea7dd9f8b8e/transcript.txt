=== TRANSCRIPT ===

Hello. Hello. Yes, hi. Hello. I called. That's a long ago. Yes, very. We take the call and then we just connect. Sorry about that. Well, really? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Oh, really? I got there to make the house. Okay. Well, at least we got each other right here right now. Listen, you're getting as I was told by my finance team. They looked into this. Now, I personally do with the atomic. But I could be honest, I never cashed out. I stopped by my script all the time. I can never move anything out of atomic. Right? Let's put it this way. So my knowledge, personal knowledge, pain-delarity. But apart checking everything up with my finance team. And they're telling me that the taxes are included in this money. So the taxes are included in this particular amount of cash. And they're asking of you. Now, how are they planning to refund it? I have no idea. Right? That's something that I was not explained. But the money that is supposed to be coming in. Who you're account? And most likely the next step will be here. Ask you for the payment details, I suppose. Where is the money going to be sent into? The money will be coming in from an account. Is that related to credit? Instead, the reason how they justify it. And I said, that's how you don't pay taxes. After the money comes into your account. You understand? Because the plan for it has nothing to do with cryptocurrency. The cash out is all. If you understand what I mean. Yeah. So what I don't understand, Benjamin, is what you told. Personal and expression is in the transfer back to index. As we plan. Yes. And then converted. Well, this is something that has to be done with the atomic support. I suppose it is possible. I think the reason why wouldn't be possible. But if you can shoot them, I'm not interested in having just a transfer to the dollar Canadian. I'm going to transfer it over to a debt by myself. But whether that's possible, like you're already who you need is. So that kind of a message. Yeah. Yeah. Because of the taxes, when you get it back to the index, when do it on our account, you put it on a special account. And for whatever you have invested, you don't have to pay taxes. Wait. Just get the correct you over there. If you want to come in and you dollar Canadian, come in and back. Right. In fact, it's impossible. There is no debate about it. Okay. The question is from what type of account or from what business is a money company name. And then that being one of the standard of largest cryptocurrency in her. So that money will be taxable at that point. You understand? Sure. The all six, yes, it will be okay. 100% there is no debate about it. And given that you have a picture with all the resources, what you've invested, right? You will have taxes. There is no question about it. Now, that atomic asset was explained over here by my finance. There's what atomic is offering. I mean, it's not clearly explained. So let's put it this way. I have to give you a disclaimer. It's a speculation. Right. A very educated speculation is put in this way. It can be explained. It can be explained. It can be explained. It can be explained. It can be explained. It can be explained. It can be explained. It can be explained. It can be clarified very much. I guess. It has a few, a couple of messages. But what am I going to do? I think is going to be a Canada transfer from your, there account for your account. There account that they will use. Well, that have any kind of relation to cryptocurrency. Watch the web, or there go the transfer that they're doing. So you will be not taxable. Now, how are they going to justify? Didn't use this feedback. I have no idea to be honest. This is not really my niche. You want to say it. I really don't clarify because in the freezer that could send me, they mentioned that it is reputable. Yes. Yeah. And if it's taxable, so that must be a Canadian company. Then they're right. Because they don't know. It was a Canadian company. So, a atomic atomic. Like, where it was founded is the talent of Sonina. So, our topic is that it's coming from a Baltic country. I don't know if you ever heard about it, Sonina. Yeah. You probably did, right? Yeah. So it's a Baltic country. And obviously, a atomic having that quarter is entirely in the Sonia. A comprise with the European Union financial laws and regulations. So, I mean, I don't know if that applies to their branch. He can't adopt very much. I'm not quite sure about it. I really don't know. But I'm guessing that there are some foolish regulations. Let's put it this way. I've had my clients withdraw a lot of money to withdraw from them. And some of these clients have, you know, tabs out there. It's kind of a count. And we haven't spoken about it afterwards. Some of them have some money left without this continued working. Nobody has ever been complaining. Nobody. Nobody ever had any sort of situation in which they haven't gotten their money. That's a mention that atomic wallet is a printer company. These way larger than us. I mean, facilitating a couple of hundreds of dollars, which law will probably even a few million dollars is a piece of cake for them. The way out yet, you know, the transactions are public. So, let's say, for example, when my clients put some money in atomic and write today, you use it for faking. Faking is investing. You're preparing a few or a certain period of time. It's called faking. When they do that, their money goes to some atomic wallet facilities. They didn't dare own wallet. And these lawyers are of course possible to be checked to feed the balances. And what kind of a amount of money is moved over there. And I can tell you, it's like they're taking wrong and you can't even think of about, you know, $60 million dollars on a 24 hour basis. They're mathed. They're super big. So, from that kind of perspective, I'm going to be information that I can gather as what I've seen with my own eyes. I can kind of push the money down atomic, solidarity, and of course there are facilities which are unprecedented. Now, how are you going to guys approach this? Of course, it's there. I need to use, of course. But let's put it this way. You might want to have thinking, why, why things, if you can get some middle amount, which in this case would be the end act. And yet, you're going to write into a channel to the bank account. I take it. And that's the main thing that, there is, on everything you get it, actually, it's a most beautiful deal you could wish for in my opinion. I mean, I mean, I said, you will approach this on what we used to but, you know, it's hard to be my kind of personal input. I'm thinking with you now, not in the capacity as an account manager, this would be like, I'm in Geneva, which is simply because I don't want to pay government, you know, 40% of my money. So, you know, I may have a little bit of a, I don't buy a sub-peting or a sub-peting or an untaxious, I'm not kind of like a boy's child. It's a good time when it comes to taxes. I will. Take advantage of every work that I can get my hands on. It's simply because I consider this to be a, I should say, I kind of a little bit of a TV, but that's opinion, right? Let's put it this way. I don't want to impose my will on you. That's my opinion. Yeah. So, it would be come to taxes and expenses of moving money or taxing out my investments. And I'm coming from your high estate, you know, in there, they would see you all right. And we got for these who get a picture in your dump or you can basically go bankrupt, you know? And so, I don't know. I have a circle of pectivone on the matter. And I'm okay to share that as perspective, but of course, like I said, I don't expect you to have my perspective. So, Benjamin Woodard worked to have them. Is it going to go send it forward to notics? And the money would be enough. And I actually mean the money would be enough, what they put in there. Yeah, of course, that was my original suggestion. The bad things, of course, you should have a manager, tell them what it would be possible to get it done like this. But if we could have you a problem, I mean, you can send me a free-to-later on. If you can ask another side question or two regarding how did they plan to justify this, and then you can get a fee, being returned, and whether that be to tax as well, taxation. But you don't have to if you don't want to. Yeah, no, no, no, good points. Yeah, good points. Yeah, because if it does, then you got your self-debted deal there is. Obviously. So, in other words, what you're saying, that extra fee, you're almost $27,000 would be including income tax, Canadian income tax, is that what you're saying? Capital gains tax. What would have income tax? Only if you are licensed and registered date makers. Meaning you do this for a living. Yeah, what's there? Capital gains tax, that's not only some benefit to what you guys are doing. You guys are not date makers. That's important for that, but they, so date makers will have income tax, right? It's included because this is their job, this is their profession, this is what they do for a living. Capital gains tax was a simple sale of the office. You have a sense? You are way that's not having any sort of information, what you do with your fading account, we're all real proof. You have a sense that there is no information about it. They only need to transfer the third amount of credit, and that you've got back a third amount of credit. Which is, in Italy, let it be, for example, like you did with that bank, right? You've got a third amount of Bitcoin. You transferred it over to some wallet. They don't know what China conversion has if it done. Did you buy Bitcoin, Bitcoin, China, Ethereum? Did you buy a lot of it? Did you buy Cardano? Did you buy some S coins that he blessed things? Where do you do all one cent? Because people do that all the time, but it just for me to clarify probably a tonics perspective. In a tonics you've noticed, Hunter, it probably not thousands of coins available over there. Make sure you have coins on a tonic are way below a cent, which means we're a couple of thousands of dollars. You would get less than 25 million or even 25 million of these coins. And if you move one of them, right? Rises, you let say, half a dollar or a dollar, people will end up making from a thousand bucks, probably a couple of hundred thousand or millions of dollars. Now for it, this is borderline gambling. But when we're talking about tax limitation of expenses, and especially in crypto, this is how you justify it, especially when we do in crypto trading. You'll go capital or Benjamin General, spend it for me, go even if there's a capital that tax for even a half or my thing. But that will be capital to gain taxes, and then who do you think? Yes, yes, yes, yes, capital to pay back. Who would keep the company? No, no. What is it? As for the message that they've said, you would get that back. I mean, I am trusting that those pages of money out of the power, if an implementation of the transfer, right? These things usually go without paying, but if you can get away with, I don't know, let's say, $69,000 in America, plus the 20, whatever they're asking in ten dollars. I'm not going to show them. But let's say, let's say it all rounds up to what? About a hundred or ten, $15,000 in England, and let's say you get back hundred and ten, I would feel some service to be an amazing deal. So, in order to break it down, right? Actress for the option of transferring it just to a maximum, do you do everything on your own and your handling everything on your own, right? Even when that does come into play. And in England, Benjamin, in England, you're afraid, don't charge for that extra fee, or you don't know. You have a fee. You have a fee for the transfer, but they are not dealing with taxes. And the spend, they will send you the money, and how will you deal with it? You deal with it. So, I've got a question for you. If you start a problem, of course. Let's try to pack bracket, are you guys in? Present it life. Let's hear a test. Can you please verify for some questions? Are you about point? No, I don't think about the point, no. No. So, yeah, I mean, and that's what it's for. For this amount, you are not supposed to pay taxes, but you can pack now because that's what we imported, invested, right? We'll be sent there. So, in terms of income, I'll charge you there is not taxes to pay. And maybe a little bit, a little bit over, but you know what I mean, right? The 60,000, you are solid. It's about each of what we sent. So, when we take that out, there shouldn't be any taxes for us. Yes, that is correct. Yeah, that should be calculated via amount of money get your transfers. Sorry, the amount of money that you withdrawing, the amount of money that you transfer. And that amount of money that you've been in the debt, but it's a bit of a typical stock. Right. Okay. Okay. I'll check everything with them. Double check everything. With them, she's a member of the business, as soon as they reply, turn your free shot, and I'll get back with you. That's okay. Good, thank you so much. No problem. Okay, I'm welcome. Okay, bye, again. Bye, Rachel.
